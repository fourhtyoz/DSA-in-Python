"""For the stack ADT, we created a very simple adapter class that used a Python list
as the underlying storage. It may be very tempting to use a similar approach for
supporting the queue ADT. We could enqueue element e by calling append(e) to
add it to the end of the list. We could use the syntax pop(0), as opposed to pop( ),
to intentionally remove the first element from the list when dequeuing.
As easy as this would be to implement, it is tragically inefficient. As we discussed
in Section 5.4.1, when pop is called on a list with a non-default index, a
loop is executed to shift all elements beyond the specified index to the left, so as to
fill the hole in the sequence caused by the pop. Therefore, a call to pop(0) always
causes the worst-case behavior of Î˜(n) time.
We can improve on the above strategy by avoiding the call to pop(0) entirely.
We can replace the dequeued entry in the array with a reference to None, andmaintain
an explicit variable f to store the index of the element that is currently at the
front of the queue. Such an algorithm for dequeue would run in O(1) time. After
several dequeue operations, this approach might lead to the configuration portrayed
in Figure 6.5."""
